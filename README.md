# Project 2: CINEMAfiles by The Cinemaphiles

## Description
This immersive app calls all cinema and devoted movie lovers to lookup their favorite cinema title (or any various cinema title!), view the title's plot and upload a personal review! The app utilizes Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API which is stored in a database using MySQL and the Sequelize ORM. The folder structure meets the MVC paradigm and uses Handlebars.js as the templating engine-.
